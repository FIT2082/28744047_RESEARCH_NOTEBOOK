# Week 8 Progress

## *Meeting*
This week, we discussed our findings from the Microsoft Azure tutorial and explored the areas in which we could expand based on the tutorial. We
found that decision forests were the most accurate apporach, producing an accuracy of 0.998 in contrast to the default logistic regression
which yielded 0.994. Arnaud and Christoph suggested that we should use the R code provided and input our dataset into the model and see what
kind of accuracy is given. 

## *Microsoft Azure Tutorial*
The ***Predictive Maintenance Modelling Guide*** was created by senior data scientists at Microsoft to help businesses with, you guessed it, 
**predictive maintenance**. This is highly relevant to our research as we would also like to identify failures before they actually occur.
The Predictive Maintenance Modelling Guide Experiment is in Azure Studio, an online platform that lets users *experiment* with different
models for their data. Below is the layout of Azure Studio - it is constructed in a flowchart-like manner and has been done so to be more
"user-friendly" especially for people with not the strongest of technical backgrounds.

But on the contrary, I really struggled with using this and given a choice would not rely on this for future model experimentation. Furthermore,
the usability of this platform is poor and simple functions such as navigating to another end of the flowchart is quite difficult. Also, running
the flowchart can take more than 5 minutes at times and as a busy university student, this is very testing at times.
However, it is good for testing general models and visualising the accuracies of such models, so during these instances I would resort 
to using Azure Studio.

## *Other Progress*
Apart from exploring the Microsoft Azure Tutorial, I thought it would be a good idea to start working on the final report. We definitely don't
have an abundance of information to write about just yet, however every now and then we jot down some points that will be relevant for later
on when we properly write the report. Drafting the final report now is also a good way to identify what gaps we have in our research and what 
we need to do in the coming weeks. With Week 9 approaching, it's important that we start training a model so that we have something tangible
to show in our poster presentation and in our final submission. 

## *Plan of Action for Week 9*
* Implement R notebook of the Microsoft Azure Studio in RStudio and try integrating Monash plant dataset with the same model.
* Keep adding to final report draft.

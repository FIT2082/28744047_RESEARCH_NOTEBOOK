# Week 3 Progress

This week we didn't have a meeting as we still don't have our dataset. 

However, Andrew and I have been working on the project specification and have made good progress. We decided it would be a good idea to get 
some more insight into potential methods so we have been looking at relevant journals. 

## *Potential Methods*
While I'm aware that general machine learning techniques and predictive methods will be used in this project, I am still
not sure what this entirely entails. Will we be using certain statistical models? How do we effectively extract meaning from the data?
In order to find a solution to these questions, reading up on literature has been extremely useful, though there aren't many journals that explore
the area of plant failure prediction. However there are papers that discuss predictive methods for other types of failure, for instance Fan Q. and Fan H.'s
[paper](http://www.joams.com/uploadfile/2014/0819/20140819035019605.pdf) on failure prediction on constructive equipment provide valuable insight
into potential methods we can adopt in this project. A major focus of this paper is time series analysis, which uses a set of observations to
forecast future events. The same principles in this paper can be applied to our project - we can observe the behaviour of plants to more 
accurately predict when they are prone to failure in the future.

I am yet to find a more suitable paper that would be useful for plant failure prediction, though hopefully I can make more progress by the end of next week.

As of now, I imagine that once we obtain the data it is imperative that we clean it and make it usable for future analysis. Once it is ready
for this step, it is important to understand what all the variables mean (there is supposedly more than 150..). By getting familiarised with
all the variables, identifying features of failure become easier and thus the time series analysis will be much more practical.

Time series analysis is definitely a useful tool that can be applied in this project, however I'm sure there are other methods, especially
machine learning techniques that we can employ to accurately predict plant failure. These should be identified in the coming weeks.

## *Plan of Action for Week 4*
* Complete Project Specification.
* Read more literature relevant to the project.

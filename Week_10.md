# Week 10 Progress

## *Meeting*
This week we did not have a meeting as we will be having a joint meeting with our supervisors and Monash Building Managers on Wednesday 10th
October.

## *Other Progress*
This week I started my decision forests implementation in R. I used the [randomForest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf) package
and there were lots of documentation online to help me write the code. I have only so far written a basic implementation, and will be adding 
more to my file in the coming days. I have created a test and train dataset, but still need to clean my data better. I have also been reading
up on literature pertinent to the project and am taking notes that will be useful to our final report.

I've also created a rough draft of our final poster and hopefully should have more information to add soon. For the timebeing, we only have
plots to show, but soon should have some more results that would be insightful for anyone viewing our poster.

## *Plan of Action for Week 11*
* Continue implementation of decision forests in R and use the new dataset against it.
* Keep adding to final report draft.
* Work on poster presentation.

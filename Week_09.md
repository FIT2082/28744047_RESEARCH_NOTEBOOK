# Week 9 Progress

## *Meeting*
This past week, Andrew and I worked on trying to implement decision forests in R. We initially thought that the Microsoft Azure Tutorial we worked
on would contain all the relevant code, but it only included basic commands such as reading in data and importing libraries. The previous week, 
Christoph had sent us a similar implementation of classifiers that he had worked on in the past. We used his code to get an idea of how we
should implement our decision forest, and have started writing up a file. However we still haven't finished this but intend to get it done by
the end of the mid-semester break. 

A good news is that the Monash Building Managers have provided us with more data that is better formatted and can be used instead as our input 
data in our tests. Christoph suggested that it would be good to meet with them to go over the data and get a clearer idea of the variables 
included. 

## *Other Progress*
I haven't added to the report draft lately as it has been quite busy with most of my other assignments due this week. I think that I will 
need to do more readings on decision forests and relevant classifiers in order to understand the implementation better. As a coincidence, in
my FIT2086 Data Modelling unit, we have just started learning about decision forests so it has come at a good time and I luckily have a few 
extra resources that I can use in this project.

## *Plan of Action for Mid-Semester Break/Week 10*
* Implement decision forests in R and use the new dataset against it.
* Literature review on decision forests and other relevant classifiers.
* Keep adding to final report draft.

# Week 2 Progress

## *Project Overview*
Plant failure prediction, as the name suggests, is the process of estimating the probability of a plant failing. 
A plant in this context refers to systems such as boilers and chillers that are used every day for several hours. Given that buildings at Monash are highly dependent
on the seamless functioning of these plants, it is imperative that they are maintained to avoid failure and thus must be monitored regularly.
This reiterates the need for this project, whereby the early prediction of potential plant failures can ensure necessary action is taken by
building managers to counteract such issues.

I will be working on this project alongside Andrew Persic, and will be under the supervision of Dr Arnaud Prouzeau and Dr Christoph Bergmeir.


## *Meeting*
This week marked the very first meeting for our project, in which we discussed specific details and got to know more about what we are expected to do.
We also learnt that the dataset has not yet been provided, though this should change in the coming weeks. Arnaud suggested that it would be
a good idea to take us to a plant as it would give us a better idea of how we should go about predicting plant failure.

Andrew and I were also advised that it would be a good idea to familiarise ourselves with R as that would be the best tool to 
use for the analysis and plotting of data. Given that most of Christoph's work is done in R, we felt it would be appropriate to conduct our
research in R as we can get more help and expertise with the different packages and libraries we may have to use later on.


## *Plan of Action for Week 3*
* Work on Project Specification and get a draft to supervisors before submission deadline.
* Get familiarised with R and read recommended material. In particular look into **_dplyr_** and **_xts_** packages.

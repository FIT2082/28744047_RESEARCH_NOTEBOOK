# Week 12 Progress

## *Meeting*
This week I had a brief meeting with Christoph to discuss other ways of predicting the accuracy of our model. He suggested that we should use
a confusion matrix to come up with a figure for the number of false positives, which would give us better insight on how many alarms occur 
but are not predicted. This test statistic is valuable to us as it is the best indication of whether the model actually works or not.

We also went over the poster and potential changes to it. The confusion matrix could not be implemented in time to include it in the poster,
so we will discuss it in our final report.

## *Other Progress*
We have played around with the confusion matrix and it has not been as straightforward as expected. Some challenges we faced were the feeding-in
of parameters and their types. Andrew came up with a matrix but we couldn't really decipher it, so we clarified with Christoph as to what 
the numbers were telling us. He said that the lack of data made it difficult to come up with an accurate matrix and there are not many alarms to begin
with. So the results may not be the most reliable and we shouldn't depend on it to verify the accuracy of our model.

## *Poster Presentation*
The poster pitches were really interesting and it was great to see the diverse range of projects that everyone worked on. It was useful to 
have people ask us questions as it helped us to reconsider what is worth focusing on in the final report.

## *Plan of Action for SWOTVAC*
* Get the report done.

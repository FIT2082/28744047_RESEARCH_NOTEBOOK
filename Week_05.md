# Week 5 Progress

## *Meeting*
This week we had a Zoom meeting with Christoph, though Arnaud was not able to attend. We discussed plots relating to the alarm faults and 
found that there was insufficient data to determine correlations between the faults and the values corresponding to the chillers. Therefore,
Christoph suggested it would be a good idea to email the Monash Building Managers and ask them for more data. 

Christoph also recommended reading up on literature as there is not a whole heap we can do before getting more data.

## *Findings in Data*
The plots of the data with the faults overlayed on top provides brief insights into possible causes of unique faults. The most identifiable
fault is a temperature fault, which occurs when the temperature crosses >22 degrees celsius. The other faults were not informative enough
to be able to associate values with occurrence of faults.

Furthermore, the data showed that reaction times to faults are generally quite slow. For instance, a temperature fault that occurred in mid-February 
took 6 days to rectify. These findings can be taken to Monash Building Managers who can then work on improving their response rates and 
be better prepared for future issues.

## *Plan of Action for Week 6*
* Draft email to Monash Building Managers.
* Read literature relevant to the project.
